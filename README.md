# Investment Options Evaluation
For this assigned we need to evaluate four new investment options for inclusion in the a client's portfolio. Weâ€™ll need to determine the fund(s) of the four listed in the data csv in the Resources Folder. We are utilizing key risk-management metrics: 
> 1. Daily rReturns 
> 2. Standard deviations
> 3. Sharpe ratios
> 4. Variance
> 5. CoVariance
> 6. Betas

## Installation

Activate Conda Dev environment make sure to install the following packages
if you do not have them already:

* pandas
* numpy
* pathlib
* os
* matplotlib (pyplot)

While you could use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install these individually please make use of the requirement text in the repo.

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ABOUT THE CODE
There isnt much to talk about here:
### 1st thing FUNCTTIONS
I created two functions.  I will continue to iterate on these functions but I want a function that will take data from either an api or a csv (maybe even a database and parse filter and clean it according to the data type. Right now we are working with  stock prices and a datetime index. As we work with other data types Ill build and add to this. The second function  takes as an argument a dataframe and returns information about it. I tend to use this while I am developing so I know at all times what I am working with.

### Future Directions: 
We would also need a function that will take care of all the plotting because  as well. it is an opportunity to increase efficiency and most importantly:
